Hi! I am Ankur Sinha, and I am currently pursuing an MS(Research) in Astronomy at IIT Indore.

Currently, I am working in Radio Astronomy, specifically on radio galaxies.

For my MS(Research) thesis, I am analyzing GMRT data to study the HI present in radio galaxies.

By doing this I intended to find the dark matter content present within the galaxy, its star formation rate, and the galaxie's overall kinematics as well.
